Building a large language model (LLM) is a costly and time-intensive endeavor. To reduce risk, we adhered closely to model designs and training strategies from recent successful models, such as OPT and BLOOM. Nevertheless, we faced numerous challenges during the training process, including loss spikes, unexpected parameter drifts, and performance plateaus.\\n\\nIn this talk, we will discuss these hurdles and our responses, which included a complete training restart after weeks of effort. Our persistence paid off: BloombergGPT ultimately outperformed existing models on financial tasks by significant margins, while maintaining competitive performance on general LLM benchmarks. We will also provide several examples illustrating how BloombergGPT stands apart from general-purpose models.\\n\\nOur goal is to provide valuable insights into the specific challenges encountered when building LLMs and to offer guidance for those debating whether to embark on their own LLM journey, as well as for those who are already determined to do so.\",\n",

Ideally, when a model encounters difficult inputs, or inputs unlike data it saw during training, it should signal to the user that it is unconfident about the prediction. Better yet, the model could offer alternative predictions when it is unsure about its best guess. Conformal prediction is a general purpose method for quantifying the uncertainty in a model's predictions, and generating alternative outputs. It is versatile, not requiring assumptions on the model and being applicable to classification and regression alike. It is statistically rigorous, providing a mathematical guarantee on model confidence. And, it is simple, involving an easy three-step procedure that can be implemented in 3-5 lines of code. In this talk I will introduce conformal prediction and the intuition behind it, along with examples of how it can be applied in real-world usecases.\",\n",

Our team at Sobeys faced the task of building a system that could communicate the value of our personalized offers to external stakeholders and inform our internal team about what works and what does not. This required us to develop an experimentation and measurement platform that could measure the effects of a hierarchy of treatment variants, compute these effects across different customer segments, and aggregate the results consistently. In this talk, we will share our experience in creating a configurable, automated process that can handle repeated experimentation and measurement. \\n\\nSimple frequentist A/B measurement approaches proved to be insufficient when measuring the effectiveness of our complex hierarchy of treatment variants, across an independent hierarchy of customer segments. The issue is that contradictory results can regularly arise when slices of hierarchical data are tested independently. For instance, two segments can show a positive lift individually, but the overall lift across both segments could be negative (this phenomenon is known as Simpson\\u2019s Paradox). Multilevel models can be leveraged in both the frequentist and Bayesian paradigm to help address this. However, in our use case the Bayesian paradigm offered several useful advantages including the capability to explicitly define the structure of the hierarchy via prior specification and better handling of smaller customer segments. \\n\\nIn general, attendees of this talk can expect to learn: \\n\\n- How to effectively assign customers to treatment variants to optimize measurement - regardless of the statistical paradigm in use. \\n\\n- The basics of Bayesian statistics and the advantages it can offer in measurement of hierarchical experiments \\n\\n- How we used this Bayesian model to attribute lift to different components of the program, compared model variants, and measured results across various customer segments \\n\\n- How we adopted an MLOps-like approach in designing our measurement platform in order to support this Bayesian model.\",\n",

Participants will explore key components of the AI software development lifecycle through first principles thinking, including prompt engineering, monitoring, evaluations, and handling non-determinism. The session focuses on using multimodal AI models to build applications, such as querying PDFs, while providing insights into the engineering challenges unique to AI systems. By the end of the workshop, participants will know how to build a PDF-querying app, but all techniques learned will be generalizable for building a variety of generative AI applications.\\n\\nIf you're a data scientist, machine learning practitioner, or AI enthusiast, this workshop can also be valuable for learning about the software engineering aspects of AI applications, such as lifecycle management, iterative development, and monitoring, which are critical for production-level AI systems.\",\n",
